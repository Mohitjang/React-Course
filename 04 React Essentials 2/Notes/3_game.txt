Tic-tac-toe game:- 

1. not all content must go into components:-  like we can write html code inside the index.html file in traditional way as well.
2. public/ vs asset/ for image storage
3. components instances works in isolation.
4. Update state using function form 
    like setValue(editiong=> !editing) - this changes the state value instant
    instead of setValue(!editing) - this schedule the changes of state which makes it slower.
5. User input OR two-way binding
6. Rendering multi-dimentional Lists
7. Updating Object state immutably - by creating copy of original game data.
8. Lifting state up.
9. derive state from props
10. sharing states Across components
